      <h1>For Store Owners</h1>
      <p>
        We get it: fees are tough on small businesses. But debit minimums shift costs to the people least able to pay
        and violate network rules.
      </p>
      <h2>Compliant options</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Small, clearly posted surcharge that complies with network rules.</li>
        <li>Cash discount programs that are transparent and honest.</li>
        <li>No surprises at the register—clarity builds trust.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why this matters</h2>
      <p>
        Our movement focuses on stopping abusive and illegal practices, not punishing local shops. We want a fair
        playing field where customers aren&apos;t penalized for using their debit cards.
      </p>
      <h2>Get verified</h2>
      <p>
        Interested in being “verified compliant” when we launch it? Reach out and we&apos;ll work with you to make sure
        your signage and practices align with network rules.
